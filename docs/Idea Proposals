Idea Proposals

Idea 1: Star gazing report in your area

Takes user location and find stars/constellations/planets/moons that would be good to look at on any given night.  
Checks weather API to see if its will be a clear/cloudy night.  Checks light pollution API to see what is visable.
Lists wheteher objects can be seen with naked eye or needs a telescope.  Possible AR night sky finder component?
Could alow easy copy paste of objects to AR app. Feature that tells you where the best location is to view the 
night sky in your immediate area based on user input for how far the user is willing to travel. Could also give
best time to veiw objects and best date to veiw them. Database could stores user as well as which objects they
are interested in and their log in locations.

Some possible APIS

Idea 2: Finances

Reccomends different investments to add to your portfolio. Given a users portfolio, we use an API to see how to further diversify
investments. Another API can be used to reccomend what the user should invest in in that specific market. A database is needed
to store user profiles and information. OAuth would be needed to log into the users portfolio with a given brokerage.
