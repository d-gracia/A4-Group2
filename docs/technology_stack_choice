For our prototype we chose to use Flask for the backend and React for the
frontend.

For the back end we were considering using Django as it was python based
and has lots of useful integrations. Ultimately we wanted something 
python based as it was the language that all of us were comfortable using
and could most easily collaborate in. While considering how we would 
connect the front end and back end, we decided that we wanted to use Axios
to link our front and back end. In talking with Dev, he told us that he 
knew that Axios worked with Flask, which was also python based. We looked
into Flask and decided that it would be better for our group, as it had 
well documented examples of how to use Axios to link it, it was python 
based, and it seemed better suited for smaller applications.

For the front end we wanted to use javascript. We did not want to use 
typescipt as none of use were comfortable with it. We looked at both 
Vue.JS and React. In the end we chose React as it there was a lot of 
documentation on how to connect Flask to React.
