As a user, I want to log in to my account to store what locations I have observed at and what objects I have tried to view. 
I want to be able to log into the software with my username and password, or use OAuth to log in. The user's account is used to 
maintain preferences of the user, as well as storing what objects the user wants to view/ has viewed in a database. Logging in 
will also allow the software to access the user's location and time to output objects (refer to other user stories on how location 
and time will be used). 

Login in to the application with your username and password.  If you do not have an account already, sign up for one. Signing up will 
consister of picking a username/email address that is not already being used by another user, as well as a password. There should also 
be a way to create an account by signing in with a third party account like Google or Facebook using OAuth. If the username/email is 
already registered the account will not be allowed to be made. If you are having trouble logging in, click the “forgot username/password” 
button for assistance. An email will be sent to the given email to reset your password. 

Upon successful login, you will be brought to the applications home page.  When you are done with your session, be sure to logout properly 
by clicking the “logout” button. Upon successful logout, you will be brought to the login page.


Revised version of this user story:
There could be users who want to use the app without logging in the app, so login is not mandatory. 
Once a user logs into their account, the user's email address and name will be stored in a database,
and so their input (zip code).
Login processes are done by using Google OAuth login components in react, so the user will log in to 
their google account.
