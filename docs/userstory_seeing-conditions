In order to maximize user experience of viewing desired constellations and stars, checking if conditions nearby 
are conducive to the outcome is imperative. Light pollution in the area will be checked to determine what objects 
are visible. Additionally, providing direct access to weather data in the desired location will allow for the user 
to determine if they would like to go view the objects. Recommendations will be made as to when the user should view 
certain objects. 

The app can then look for locations where there are better viewing conditions, such as better weather and less light 
pollution. The location can then be given to the user via google maps. The app will also look for the best time to view 
objects by seeing when they would be visible in the night sky and again checking other APIs to check for a time with 
better conditions.

To see the light pollution in a given area, start a light pollution query.  Search for light pollution by place name 
(city/town/etc.) or by coordinates in latitude, longitude format.  To check the weather in your area, start a weather query.  
To enable notifications for good seeing conditions, set a notification with necessary weather conditions filters.
