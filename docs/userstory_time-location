This user story is necessary so the user can get a list 
of visible objects in their location or a specific location.

The app will need the time and location of the user, either 
by taking the userâ€™s location data, or from the user inputting 
a time and location. The app will use this to calculate what 
objects are visible in the night sky at that time and location. 
The app can then use the list of possible objects as well as data 
from weather and light pollution apis to find what objects would be 
optimal for viewing at the time and location. 


Revised version of this user story:
The app will get the location of the user from the user inputting 
a zip code. The app will use this and map api to get user's location as 
latitude and longitude. By sending latitude and longitude values to 
weather api, the app gets hourly weather report, so it is not
necessary to take time information from the user anymore.
