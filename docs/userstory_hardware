This user story is necessary because users will want and 
need to know what hardware they need to view certain objects 
in the night sky.

As a user, I want to know what hardware I need to see certain 
objects.  When picking objects to return to the user, the app 
will check the magnitude of the objects that would be in the 
sky at the time the user specifies. Depending on the magnitude 
of the object the app will determine what hardware the user will 
need to see the object. When the app returns a table to the user, 
it will include what hardware is needed to see each object on the 
table (eyes, binoculars, a hobbyist telescope, a scientific telescope, etc.). 

During a regular query (check normal output user story), 
hardware that is required to view an object should be listed next
to each object by default.  To only see objects that can be viewed 
with certain hardware, set a hardware filter during a regular user query.
