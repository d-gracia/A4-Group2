As the software I want to know what hardware the user has to be able 
to tell what objects they will be able to see. When looking for visible 
objects to return to the objects to the user, I will look at the magnitude
of the objects that would be in the sky at the time the user specifies. 
Depending on the magnitude of the object I will determine what hardware the 
user will need to see the object. When I return the table to the user I will 
include what they will need to see objects on the table, i.e. their eyes, 
binoculars, a hobbyist telescope, a scientific telescope. 

During a regular query (check normal use user story), hardware that is 
required to view an object should be listed next to each object by default.
To only see objects that can be viewed with certain hardware, set a hardware filter during a regular user query.
