As I user I want to be able to be told what stars/constellations/planets/moons 
would be good to view at a given time and location. After log in (see log in user story) 
the software will ask for time and location data to look for possible objects for the 
user to stargaze at. If this permission has been granted, then the app automatically 
generates suggestions based on the userâ€™s current time and location. If not, then the 
user has the option to enter any location/time of their choice. Suggestions can also be 
generated based on a future time within 24 hours inputted by the user 
(for either current location or manually inputted location) based on the future data, 
to allow the user to see what will be visible at night if they are using the app during
the day. Depending on the location and time given to the software, the app will return a 
table of objects that are visbable to the user based on how likely the user will be able 
to see the object and how popular the object is to look att. The output table will be 
include a list of objects, the best time to view them, the RA and Dec of the object 
(the coordinates of where it is in the sky), the hardware needed to view the object, 
as well as magnitude of the object. There should also be an ability to search for 
specific objects in the sky, where based on the users location and time the software 
will output what if it is visible, when it will become visible if it isnt already 
visible, as well as the other information in the table. The user should also be able 
to save what objects they have viewed or save objects they are interested in. They
will have access to their saved objects so that they can quickly search for them 
later if they want. The suggestion should also output good spots to view the sky in 
the area, a radius can also be inputted by the user in settings, to say how far the 
user is able to move. These take into account light pollution and scenery (parks, etc.)
