Idea 1: Star gazing report in your area

Takes user location and find stars/constellations/planets/moons that would be good to look at on any given night.  
Checks weather to see if its will be a clear/cloudy night.  Checks light pollution nearby.  Lists wheteher objects 
can be seen with naked eye or needs a telescope.  Possible AR night sky finder component?  Feature that tells you
where the best location is to view the night sky in your immediate area based on user input for how far the user is 
willing to travel.


Idea 2: Finances

Reccomends different investments to add to your portfolio. Given a users portfolio, we use an API to see how to further diversify
investments. Another API can be used to reccomend what the user should invest in in that specific market. A database is needed
to store user profiles and information. OAuth would be needed to log into the users portfolio with a given brokerage.
