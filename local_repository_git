A file to explain how to work from a local git repository

(Hopefully I got all of the steps)


Open terminal
Go to the location where you want to local repo

git clone https://github.com/d-gracia/A4-Group2.git

cd A4-Group2     

git remote add origin https://github.com/d-gracia/A4-Group2.git


git commit -m "initial commit"     
(This may or may not be needed)




To push an update

git add (name of file)

git commit -m "name of the commit"

git push origin main   



To update local

git fetch    

git merge origin
