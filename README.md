# A4-Group2
Welcome to the group project repository for section A4-Group 2 in AS 411!

This readme will explain how to navigate our directory.

1). The Final Project folder.  Everything that actually matters to our final project lives here.  The actual frontend and backend that works lives here.  

The rest of the folders were made throughout the duration of the project and are used for testing purposes

2). The backend folder.  This folder was the start of our backend in flask.  Contains our initial attempts to work with flask.

3). The frontend folder.  This folder was the start of our frontend in react.  Contains our initial attempts to work with react.

4). The cs411_gitTutorial-master folder.  This folder was our main folder for everything in our project until we created the Final Project folder to replace it.  This folder was getting a bit messy and we decided that instead of trying to clean and rename it, we would just make a new folder.
