This folder represents the state of our project right up until we created the Final Project folder.

We were still actively using this folder to run test code to be implemented in the final project.  This was sort of a "save state" that we knew worked so if we messed anything up we could revert to an earlier version that worked.

Vice-versa we also used this as a sort of sandbox to mess around with so we could break it and not break our final project.  Therefore, it is a bit messy in here, but it is intended to be that way :)

The sendTesting folder contains all the frontend and backend code we were messign around with.
